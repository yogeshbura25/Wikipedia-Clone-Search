# Wikipedia-Clone-Search
The Wikipedia Search Application is a web-based tool that simplifies the search for Wikipedia articles. Users can enter keywords in the input field, initiate a search, and view the search results. 
This project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap components, providing a seamless search experience with loading indicators.

- **User Interface**: A straightforward interface with an input field for users to enter search keywords.

- **Search Results Display**: The application dynamically displays search results within the "search-results" container, including article titles, clickable links, and descriptions.

- **Loading Spinner**: A Bootstrap loading spinner component is incorporated to provide visual feedback while making HTTP requests.

- **HTTP Request**: The application uses the `fetch` API to communicate with the Wikipedia search API, which returns search results in JSON format.

- **Dynamic Updates**: Retrieved data is dynamically updated within HTML elements, making titles clickable and presenting descriptions in a readable format.
